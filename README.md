+ Review: Site gathers all data fetched as intended, buttons are also fully functional and search works fine for the most part, it even gives you a message about the Pokemon past Gen 5 being invalid, favorites work as intended and the buttons shift place based on desktop or mobile as intended. I like how the background is based on the Unova Pokedex's grid, I did the same thing, and the favorite button is a Loveball, that's very neat. Now the criticisms I have is that the buttons lack a background, the text overflow on mobile goes past the purple background by a bit on mobile, the navbar should also have a background to differentate itself from the grid background. Overall though it's very neat and fully functional based on what we were taught. Also I like how the README logs the progress added in... if that's a part of what we have to do that's concerning on my part.
